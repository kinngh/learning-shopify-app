# Learning The Shopify Platform

`Work In Progress` | The codebase I use to explore what's new on the Shopify platform and how things work.

## Why I made this

Every new change on the Shopify platform needs to be tested thoroughly before deploying to maintain app quality, since the apps you build as a developer are directly / indirectly responsible to put food on the table for our merchants. This is more of an explorer's repository where all possilbe webhooks, scopes, etc are registered to assess payload and see what's happening in the background because a lot of times we don't read that specific documentation set or it's not documented at all.

This is how I explore the platform with docs open on the side. I'll be adding in more content to allow exploring the platform in a more meaningful way and all suggestions are welcome! Please use the discussions tab on the repo or message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kinngh).

If you're looking for just the boilerplate this repo uses, you can take a look at the [Shopify Node.js x Express.js x React.js Boilerplate](https://github.com/kinngh/shopify-node-express-mongodb-app).
